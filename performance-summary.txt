PERFORMANCE TEST SUMMARY
========================

Test Duration: 176.72s
Tests Run: 9
Average Test Duration: 22043.88ms

MEMORY USAGE:
  Heap Delta: -0.10MB
  RSS Delta: -0.02MB

PERFORMANCE:
  Slowest Test: Network Performance Benchmarks Transaction API Performance should benchmark bulk transaction processing
  Fastest Test: Network Performance Benchmarks FFI Performance should benchmark basic FFI function calls

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • Consider optimizing test performance - average duration is high (>5s)
  • Some tests are very slow (>30s) - consider breaking them down or optimizing
  • 2 performance tests failed - investigate test environment or implementation
