# Deprecated Dependencies Analysis

## Current Status

The project currently has 6 moderate severity vulnerabilities from deprecated dependencies, all originating from the `dbus-next` package chain used for Linux secure storage integration.

## Dependency Chain

```
dbus-next → usocket → node-gyp@7.1.2 → request → tough-cookie
                                      → xml2js
```

## Affected Packages

- **request**: Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability
- **tough-cookie**: Prototype Pollution vulnerability (<4.1.3)
- **xml2js**: Prototype Pollution vulnerability (<0.5.0)

## Impact Assessment

- **Scope**: These are transitive dependencies only used in Linux secure storage
- **Risk**: Low-Medium (not directly exposed in public APIs)
- **Platforms**: Only affects Linux deployments using D-Bus Secret Service

## Mitigation Options

### 1. Monitor and Wait (Current Approach)
- Monitor `dbus-next` for dependency updates
- The maintainers are generally responsive to security issues

### 2. Alternative Packages
- `@tanislav000/dbus-next`: Maintained fork with potential updates
- Direct FFI binding to libdbus (high complexity)

### 3. Platform-Specific Fallback
- Use encrypted file storage on Linux when D-Bus is unavailable
- Already implemented in the storage layer

## Recommendation

Continue with current `dbus-next` dependency while:
1. Monitoring for upstream fixes
2. Ensuring encrypted file fallback works correctly
3. Considering the maintained fork if security fixes aren't published upstream

The benefits of Linux secure storage integration outweigh the transitive dependency risks for this SDK.
